## Warning

This is a work in progress. It has some bugs still.

The blur doesn't work, it uses transparency only.

## Installation

Make sure you have the "User Themes" extension turned on.

To install, copy one of the themes in the `Themes` folder and paste it in `~/.local/share/themes` or `~/.themes`, and select the theme in Gnome Tweaks.

## Tweaking

Make sure to tweak themes inside the original Myopia-GTK repository.

There are some basic customization on every theme folder, called `Myopia-Settings.scss`. You can customize colors, transparency and other stuff in this file.

Then, open the selected theme folder on terminal and type `./parse-sass.sh`, this will generate your new css file on gtk-3.0.

After all of these steps, follow the Installation guide to get your new Myopia customized theme ;)
